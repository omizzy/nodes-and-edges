     * A directed path in a digraph
     * is a sequence of vertices in which
     * there is a (directed) edge pointing
     * from each vertex in the sequence to
     * its successor in the sequence,
     * with no repeated edges.
     *
     * A directed path is simple if it has no repeated vertices.
     *
     * A directed cycle is a directed path
     * (with at least one edge) whose first
     * and last vertices are the same.
     *
     * A directed cycle is simple if
     * it has no repeated vertices
     * (other than the requisite repetition
     * of the first and last vertices).

## todo:

- plural version of classes
- handle polymorphism better.
